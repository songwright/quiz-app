# Code Quiz

This is a web application that gives the user a quiz on JavaScript. I made this for my full-stack development boot camp at the UCLA Extension School.

## Instructions

Click on "Start Quiz." Answer the multiple choice questions before time runs out on the timer. Your score will be based on the time left. Fifteen seconds will be deducted for each wrong answer. The faster you finish the quiz, the higher your score. Record your initials when you get a high score!
